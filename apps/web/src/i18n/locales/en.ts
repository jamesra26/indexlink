          'The CAPE percentile shows where the current Shiller P/E sits within its own historical distribution. A higher percentile means valuation is more expensive relative to history and usually reduces allocation; a lower percentile suggests cheaper valuation and may support overweighting.',

          'The ERP percentile shows where the current equity risk premium sits within its own historical distribution. Unlike CAPE, a higher ERP percentile means stocks offer more compensation over risk-free assets and valuation pressure is lower; a lower ERP percentile means compensation is thin and the system becomes more cautious.',
        ma200:
          'The MA200-distance percentile shows how far the current price is from its 200-day moving average relative to history. A higher percentile means price is far above its long-term average and may indicate overheating; a lower percentile means price is near or below the average, but may also reflect weakening trend.',
        rsi:
          'The RSI percentile shows where the current RSI sits within its own historical distribution. A higher percentile usually indicates strong momentum and possible overbought conditions, so the system may reduce chasing risk; a lower percentile indicates weaker momentum or oversold conditions, but should be checked with VIX and trend context.',
        vix:
          'The VIX percentile shows where current market volatility and fear sit within history. A higher percentile means stronger fear and higher short-term drawdown risk, which may trigger falling-knife protection; a lower percentile means calmer markets, but not necessarily low risk.',
